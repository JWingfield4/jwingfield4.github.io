  SHORES OF FAR OFF LANDS
</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">  </p>
  <p>Americas' Pacific holdings had been the center of many conflicts, starting in 1898.</p>
   <p> From the Alaskan coast, to manilla bay, and ending in Hawaii, this 'shield' acted as a buffer between us and our asiatic enemies, and still does to this day. In 1905 major investments in fortifications in the Philippines were made by the US. Unfortunately, the US would not develop many of their other pacific holdings until the late 1930s and early 1940s. By that point in time, it was too late to halt the Japanese expansion. A request to build fortifications at Guam in 1938 was denied, but further construction and expansion of pre-existing fortifications in the Philippines was on-going. Midway Atoll was also recieving additional fortifications, albiet minor in comparrison to what the Philippines was recieving. One of the most uniquely designed fortifications was Fort Drum. Fort Drum was nicknamed 'the Concrete battleship' because it was built on a rock island in Manilla bay and featured two twin barrel naval turrets. Fort Drum was one of the last standing forts during the Japanese invasion, surrendering just shortly after the fall of Corregidor. Years later, US forces would retake Fort Drum. After recapture, the Fort was abandoned due to its condition being unrepairable. </p> 
     <p>Though there are far less forts than the other locations, these forts served an extremely important role in halting Japanese expansion in the Pacific.
